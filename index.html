				<h2>Code<span></span></h2>
				My passion for code started long time ago when Flash was at it's hipe. I loved the fact that I can design and create interactive content with this software. The times of Flash are long gone now and naturally I have shifted from ActionScript to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
				Code to me is both, language I speak to the browser and a blank canvas I can draw on. Front End frameworks complement and balance each other.
				HTML let's me build the structure, CSS adds styling and JavaScript interactivity.

				<h2>Design<span></span></h2>
				Starting with basic websites several years ago I found myself working as an Art Director for complex projects with a holistic approach soon. Visually appealing designs, subtle details and brand guidelines combined to innovative interfaces across various touch points became my daily companion.
Out of this love for aesthetic design my passion for functionality and structure evolved. Jumping right into Photoshop didn't feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building a framework based on functionality and usability became inevitable.
